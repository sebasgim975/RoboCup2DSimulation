# RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation

This Soccer Simulation Game, developed using Qt 13.0.1 Community Edition, organizes a 5-minute match between two teams, each composed of six players divided into four distinct roles. It operates with minimal user interaction, automatically controlling the game's flow and player positioning.
